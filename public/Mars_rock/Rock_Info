Rock 1: Basalt
"Basalt is a dark volcanic rock formed from rapidly cooled lava. It's the most common rock type on Mars, making up much of the planet's crust and surface. On Earth, basalt is found in volcanic regions like Hawaii and Iceland. The presence of basalt on Mars tells us the planet was once volcanically active."

Rock 2: Hematite
"Hematite is an iron oxide mineral that gives Mars its distinctive reddish color. This mineral typically forms in the presence of water, making it a key indicator that liquid water once existed on Mars. NASA's rovers have found large deposits of hematite in areas that were likely ancient lake beds."

Rock 3: Olivine
"Olivine is a greenish silicate mineral commonly found in volcanic rocks. It forms deep underground under high temperatures and pressures. Olivine weathers quickly when exposed to water, so finding intact olivine on Mars suggests these areas have remained dry for billions of years, giving us clues about Mars's climate history."

Rock 4: Magnetite
"Magnetite is a black magnetic iron oxide mineral. It can form through volcanic activity or by interaction with water. Finding magnetite on Mars is significant because some forms of magnetite on Earth are created by bacteria, leading scientists to search for similar biosignatures on Mars as evidence of past microbial life."

Rock 5:Gypsum
"Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral that forms when water evaporates from mineral-rich solutions. Its presence on Mars provides strong evidence that liquid water once flowed on the surface. The Mars rover Curiosity discovered gypsum veins, suggesting that water repeatedly flowed through cracks in Martian rocks billions of years ago."
